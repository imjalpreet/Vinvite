Our project is basically to design a Mobile Application which can be used by various people to send Video Invitations to their friends and family for any event they are planning to arrange such as Wedding, Birthdays, etc. 


The app would allow users to:


1. Choose an invitation script that the invitee can read


2. Take a video


3.The video can be transformed by using filters.


4.The user also has the option to add a background score


5.Finally the user can share this in his social networks.


This Project is basically designed for any Human being who wants to organize an event such as Birthdays, Weddings, Anniversaries, etc. There is a large group of end-users who can use this product for sending invitations to their friends and family. There is no such event in which invitations are not sent to people, so this project will be an innovative way to send those invitations..
